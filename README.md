Pt.3 Check Your Understanding: <br>
1. No because a unit test may not be the best choice to test the overall "message" feature of a messaging application if it involves writing and sending a message to another user. This is because the "message" feature involves multiple components working together, including the UI for messages, the network code for sending messages, and the server-side handling of the messages. Testing this feature in its entirety is better suited for integration or end-to-end tests rather than just relying on unit tests. <br>
2. Yes, you would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because this feature is a good candidate for unit testing. It has a very specific functionality, which is ensuring that the input does not exceed 80 characters. This feature can be easily isolated in a unit test. <br>
